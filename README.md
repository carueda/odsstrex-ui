ODSS-TREX Planning Editor

This is the service for the T-REX planning component in the ODSS

Preliminary; it is a prototype yet to be integrated into the main ODSS codebase.


index3.html: obsolete

index4.html: a token is composed of 4 blocks: background, start, body, end

index4_1.html: refactoring of index4.html to separate timeline widget
functionality

index5.html:
- a token is again only one block

TODO:

- make all tokens be fully formatted UTC, so add "Z" to the ones coming
  from T-rex. ONLY convert to local for purposes of the base timeline widget.

- code clean up!!
